# Machine Learning Projects

## Project 1: Signal Quality Prediction

### Overview
This project focuses on building a regression model to predict signal quality for a communications equipment manufacturing company. By analyzing signal parameters, the model helps determine the final signal strength numerically.

### Features
- **Domain**: Electronics and Telecommunication
- **Objective**: Develop a neural network regressor to predict signal quality based on various signal parameters.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Import and explore the data.
  2. Perform statistical and exploratory data analysis (EDA) using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate techniques.
  3. Engineer features and identify hidden patterns to improve analysis and predictions.
  4. Design, train, and tune a neural network regressor to achieve optimal performance.
  5. Save the trained model for future use with Pickle.

## Project 2: Street View Digit Recognition

### Overview
This project aims to develop a neural network-based classifier to recognize digits in real-world street view images. Using the SVHN dataset, the model helps transcribe house numbers, supporting applications like map creation and address identification.

### Features
- **Domain**: Autonomous Vehicles
- **Objective**: Build a neural network classifier for digit recognition in images from the SVHN dataset.
- **Key Steps**:
  1. Import and preprocess the dataset (h5py files).
  2. Visualize the data to understand patterns and distractors in images.
  3. Train and tune a neural network for accurate digit classification.
  4. Plot and analyze training/validation loss and accuracy against the number of epochs.
